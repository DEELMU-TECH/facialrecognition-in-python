# facialrecognition-in-python
This contains a fairly rudemetary facial recognition system in python. you save the code in a folder in the desktop, then create two folders called "knownfaces" and "unknownfaces" respectively place  the photos of the single person you want to be identified in the knownfaces folder in a folder with any name you want and the ones to be tested in the unknownfaces folder. I will be posting another one for facial recognition from a video real soon and others.you can use the files I've uploaded for a sort of plug and play experience. you will need to install face_recognition and  opencv-python using pip. if you are using python 3.7 or higher you might have problems installing the dlib using wheel so you might be better off to install using "conda install -c conda-forge dlib" in cmd in admin mode in windows. hope this helps with all the problems you might face.
